# Domain Migration Summary

## What Was Done

Successfully restructured the ACE Remodeling monorepo to use a `src/domains/` pattern for better organization and scalability.

## Changes Made

### 1. Created New Structure

```
src/
â”œâ”€â”€ domains/              # NEW: All domain-specific code
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ pm-toolkit/      # Moved from src/pm-toolkit/
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ vendors/         # Moved from src/vendors/
â”‚   â””â”€â”€ README.md        # NEW: Documentation for domains
â”œâ”€â”€ shared/              # Shared business logic
â”œâ”€â”€ forms/               # Form handling utilities
â”œâ”€â”€ utils/               # General utilities
â”œâ”€â”€ tables/              # Table rendering utilities
â”œâ”€â”€ ui/                  # UI components
â””â”€â”€ globals/             # Global configurations
```

### 2. Updated TypeScript Configuration

- Updated `tsconfig.json` project references to point to `src/domains/pm-toolkit` and `src/domains/vendors`
- Added new path mapping `@domains/*` for domain imports
- Updated `@pm/*` path to reflect new structure
- Fixed include/exclude patterns to prevent build conflicts
- Created individual `tsconfig.json` files for each domain and shared module

### 3. Fixed Import Paths

- Updated all relative imports in pm-toolkit domain to reflect new structure
- Fixed vendors domain imports to use correct relative paths
- Created missing `parse-vendor-response.ts` file with proper implementation
- Fixed type issues in vendor response parsing

### 4. Updated Build System

- **esbuild.config.js**: Updated path aliases and domain entry points to use new structure
- **package.json**: Updated all script paths to reference new domain locations
- **clasp-build.js**: Fixed UI file copying path to work with new structure
- **Workspaces**: Updated npm workspaces to point to new domain location

### 5. Created Documentation

- Added `src/domains/README.md` with:
  - Structure overview
  - Guidelines for adding new domains
  - Import patterns
  - Best practices

## Benefits Achieved

1. **Clear Separation**: Domain-specific code is now clearly separated from shared utilities
2. **Scalability**: Easy to add new domains without cluttering the top level
3. **Consistency**: Aligns with existing patterns in pm-toolkit
4. **Maintainability**: Clear boundaries between different business domains
5. **Documentation**: Clear guidelines for future development

## Technical Fixes Applied

1. **Build System**: Fixed TypeScript project references and build order
2. **Import Paths**: Updated all relative imports to work with new structure
3. **Missing Files**: Created missing `parse-vendor-response.ts` implementation
4. **Type Safety**: Fixed type issues in vendor response parsing
5. **Build Conflicts**: Resolved TypeScript build conflicts by cleaning build directories
6. **esbuild Configuration**: Updated path aliases and domain entry points
7. **Package Scripts**: Updated all npm scripts to use new domain paths
8. **UI File Copying**: Fixed clasp-build.js to copy UI files from correct location

## Next Steps

1. **Test the build** âœ… COMPLETE - All modules build successfully
2. **Update any remaining import paths** âœ… COMPLETE - All imports working
3. **Test deployment** âœ… COMPLETE - `npm run push:pm` works successfully
4. **Add new domains** - Ready to follow established pattern
5. **Consider adding domain-specific tests** - Future enhancement

## Import Patterns

- Domain-specific imports: `@/domains/[domain-name]/...`
- Shared utility imports: `@/shared/...`, `@/utils/...`, etc.
- Cross-domain dependencies should be avoided - use shared utilities instead

## Migration Status: âœ… COMPLETE

All domains have been successfully migrated to the new structure. The monorepo is now ready for future growth with a clean, scalable architecture. All TypeScript compilation passes successfully and the build/deployment pipeline works perfectly! ðŸŽ‰
